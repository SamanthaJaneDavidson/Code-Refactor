# Horiseon Code-Refactor

## Description 
The goal of this project was to refactor existing code to adhere to accessibility standards, a well as consolidate and reorganize the CSS file. Generic HTML elements were replaced with semantic elements, including additions of header, nav, section, aside, and footer. Classes and IDs were consolidated and updated where appropriate. Title and image alt attributes were also added.
